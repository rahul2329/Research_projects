## 🛡️ Project 1: PUF-Based Protocol for Wi-Fi Authentication in IoT Devices

### 📖 Overview

The Internet of Things (IoT) is central to innovations in smart cities, industrial automation, and connected vehicles. However, its rapid growth has raised significant **security and privacy challenges** due to limited computational resources on IoT devices.

To address these challenges, this project introduces a **PUF-based (Physically Unclonable Function) authentication protocol** that enhances Wi-Fi security, especially during the connection setup phase — a known vulnerability in current wireless standards.

### 🔑 Key Features

- ✅ **Lightweight Protocol**  
  Designed specifically for resource-constrained IoT devices, ensuring efficient operation with minimal computational and memory overhead.

- 🔒 **Enhanced Security with PUF**  
  Utilizes PUFs to generate **tamper-resistant and unclonable hardware identities** based on manufacturing variances.

- 🔁 **Multi-Challenge Authentication**  
  Implements a **three challenge-response pair mechanism** to bolster authentication robustness.

- 📡 **Wi-Fi Integration**  
  Works alongside existing Wi-Fi protocols to protect against threats like MAC spoofing, rogue access points, and de-authentication attacks.

- 🌐 **Resilience in Unsecured Environments**  
  Suitable for deployment in insecure or extreme environments with minimal human oversight.
