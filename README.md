## Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

###  Overview
This project was developed as a **mini project during my 6th semester**, with the goal of detecting fake news using various machine learning models. The primary objective was to build a system that can effectively **differentiate between real and fake news articles** with high accuracy.

###  Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Applied techniques such as **tokenization**, **stemming**, and **stopword removal** to clean and standardize the dataset before training.

- **Feature Extraction**
  - Used multiple methods to convert text into numerical form, including:
    - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
    - **Word2Vec**
    - **Word Embedding**

- **Model Training**
  - Trained and evaluated several machine learning models:
    - **TF-IDF-based classifier**
    - **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
    - **Word2Vec-based model**
    - **Word Embedding-based classifier**

- **Performance Evaluation**
  - Measured performance using standard metrics to validate model reliability:
    - **Accuracy**
    - **Precision**
    - **Recall**
    - **F1-Score**
